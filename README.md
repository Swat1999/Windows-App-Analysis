# Windows-App-Analysis
This repo contains the raw data collected from Kaggle, The Jupyter notebook where the cleaning and analysis was done and output file of the clean data.

The reason why the Notebook is named as part 2 is because on the first part i made a small mistake that bought a big problem so had to redo

1. Various columns in the dataset was cleaned starting from cleaning null values, changing data types, simplifying column-row values and more.
2. The analysis was done mainly on finding the highest occurance of publishers and app category.


Please note that this analysis could have been done in a much better way if you can see my codes as i am still relatively new to this data analysis work but it was worth a try.
